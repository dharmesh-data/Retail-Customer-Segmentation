## üìã Summary 

In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

### The need of customer segmentation:

The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:

* Target Marketing
* Client understanding
* Optimal product placement
* Searching for new customers
* Revenue growth


### Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:

The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

<b>Recency</b> ‚Äì How recently did the customer purchase?

<b>Frequency</b> ‚Äì How often do they purchase?

<b>Monetary Value</b> ‚Äì How much do they spend?

A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.

### Approach taken
* Data inspection
* EDA / Feature analysis
* Data preparation
* Create RFM model
* Implementing various clustering

## Conclusions:

### Descriptive Analysis

**The data exploration of Online customer segmentation dataset shows :**

* Missing and duplicate values were found.
* Most of the purchases are from the United Kingdom.
* Most of the customers have purchased items on Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday.
* Most of the customers have purchased items in November, October, December, and the least number of purchases in April, January, February.
* Most of the customers purchase in the afternoon time. The 12th hour of the day is a peak for purchasing items.

### Model Analysis


**After applying various algorithms, optimal number of cluster is equal to 3.**



### Further analysis

‚óè New variables have been added, such as tenure, which is the number of days since each customer's first transaction. This will reveal how long each customer has been a member of the system.

‚óè Customers are being segmented more deeply based on their physical location, as well as demographic and psychographic factors.
